## 📚 Course Materials

### 🌀 **Complex Variables and Integral Transforms**  
> Wandering the complex plane, glimpsing cosmic symmetries through residues.  
> Includes lecture notes, classic problem sets, and poetic reflections on Fourier transforms.

### 🔭 **University Physics**  
> From Newton’s apple to Maxwell’s fields—  
> Force and light weave the fabric of reality.  
> Features concise notes and mind maps on mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics.

### 💡 **Digital Circuits**  
> A binary poem written in 0s and 1s,  
> Where logic gates stitch the threads of reason.  
> Covers combinational logic, sequential circuit design, and an introduction to Verilog.

### 🌊 **Analog Circuits**  
> Currents flow like rivers; voltages rise like mountains.  
> Amplifiers hum with the echoes of sound itself.  
> Contains transistor analysis, op-amp applications, and filter design resources.

### 🔬 **Electronics Laboratory**  
> Soldering wires, igniting inspiration.  
> Lab reports, circuit schematics, and debugging insights—  
> Capturing every spark of discovery.

### 🧮 **Discrete Mathematics**  
> Sets, graphs, logic, and algebra—  
> The skeleton of the abstract world takes shape here.  
> Includes detailed notes on propositional logic, graph algorithms, and relational algebra.

### 📜 **Principles of Marxism (Marxism Fundamentals)**  
> Rowing upstream in the river of dialectics,  
> Witnessing how history is written through praxis.  
> Compiles core concepts, excerpts from classical texts, and reflective study notes.
